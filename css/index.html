        <p>Mare Molly Barrow is the main character of Victoria Aveyard's Red Queen. She was born into a poor family in the Stilts
            where she started pickpocketing as a way to help her family survive. Cal Calore from whom she tried and failed to steal 
            from, thinking him a regular tavern patron, got her a job as a servant in the Hall of the Sun. During an event in the Hall
            her electricon abilities were displayed in an accident revealing them not only to herself for the first time, but also to the 
            whole silver elite. </p>
